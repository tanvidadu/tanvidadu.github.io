Dedicated chatbot appliances are also becoming increasingly common, such as Amazon&amp;rsquo;s Alexa. These chatbots can perform a wide variety of functions based on user commands. Non-goal-oriented dialogue systems (chatbots) are an interesting test-bed for interactive Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems and are also directly useful in a wide range of applications ranging from technical support services to entertainment.</description></item><item><title>PERSONABOT : PERSON OR MACHINE</title><link>https://tanvidadu.github.io/projects/creations/personabot/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tanvidadu.github.io/projects/creations/personabot/</guid><description>Chatbots are often used online and in messaging apps, but are also now included in many operating systems as intelligent virtual assistants, such as Siri for Apple products and Cortana for Windows.

This can often create a sense of panic and confusion if the sources are not reliable. In the case of skin diseases, where it might be very hard to describe the exact condition through verbal description, diagnosis through image recognition could be the future of skin disease detection. There already exist some applications which diagnose skin diseases through the textual description provided by the user.</description></item><item><title>DERMADOC: THE SKIN SPECIALIST APPLICATION</title><link>https://tanvidadu.github.io/projects/creations/dermahack/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tanvidadu.github.io/projects/creations/dermahack/</guid><description>It’s a common practice among people to refer the internet or various easily accessible resources before they consult a doctor.
