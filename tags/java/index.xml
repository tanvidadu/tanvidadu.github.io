This can often create a sense of panic and confusion if the sources are not reliable. In the case of skin diseases, where it might be very hard to describe the exact condition through verbal description, diagnosis through image recognition could be the future of skin disease detection. There already exist some applications which diagnose skin diseases through the textual description provided by the user.</description></item><item><title>DERMADOC: THE SKIN SPECIALIST APPLICATION</title><link>https://tanvidadu.github.io/projects/creations/dermahack/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tanvidadu.github.io/projects/creations/dermahack/</guid><description>It’s a common practice among people to refer the internet or various easily accessible resources before they consult a doctor.
