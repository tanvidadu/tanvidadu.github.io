This phenomenon has given rise to the growing need to detect the offensive language used in social media cross-lingually. In OffensEval 2020, the organizers have released the multilingual Offensive Language Identification Dataset (mOLID), which contains tweets in five different languages, to detect offensive language. In this work, we introduce a cross-lingual inductive approach to identify the offensive language in tweets using the contextual word embedding XLM-RoBERTa (XLM-R).</description></item><item><title>Towards Code-switched Classification Exploiting Constituent Language Resources</title><link>https://tanvidadu.github.io/blog/codeswitchsrw/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tanvidadu.github.io/blog/codeswitchsrw/</guid><description>Code-switching is a commonly observed communicative phenomenon denoting a shift from one language to another within the same speech exchange. The analysis of code-switched data often becomes an assiduous task, owing to the limited availability of data. In this work, we propose converting code-switched data into its constituent high resource languages for exploiting both monolingual and cross-lingual settings. This conversion allows us to utilize the higher resource availability for its constituent languages for multiple downstream tasks.</description></item><item><title>Sarcasm Detection using Context Separators in Online Discourse</title><link>https://tanvidadu.github.io/blog/sarcasmdetect/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tanvidadu.github.io/blog/sarcasmdetect/</guid><description>Sarcasm is an intricate form of speech, where meaning is conveyed implicitly. Being a convoluted form of expression, detecting sarcasm is an assiduous problem. The difficulty in recognition of sarcasm has many pitfalls, including misunderstandings in everyday communications, which leads us to an increasing focus on automated sarcasm detection. In the second edition of the Figurative Language Processing (FigLang 2020) workshop, the shared task of sarcasm detection released two datasets, containing responses along with their context sampled from Twitter and Reddit.</description></item><item><title>BERT-based Ensembles for Modeling Disclosure and Support in Conversational Social Media Text.</title><link>https://tanvidadu.github.io/blog/affcon/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tanvidadu.github.io/blog/affcon/</guid><description>There is a growing interest in understanding how humans initiate and hold conversations. The affective understanding of conversations focuses on the problem of how speakers use emotions to react to a situation and to each other. In the CL-Aff Shared Task, the organizers released Get it #OffMyChest dataset, which contains Reddit comments from casual and confessional conversations, labeled for their disclosure and supportiveness characteristics. In this paper, we introduce a predictive ensemble model exploiting the finetuned contextualized word embeddings, RoBERTa and ALBERT.</description></item></channel></rss>
