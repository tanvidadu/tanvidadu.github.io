Dedicated chatbot appliances are also becoming increasingly common, such as Amazon&amp;rsquo;s Alexa. These chatbots can perform a wide variety of functions based on user commands. Non-goal-oriented dialogue systems (chatbots) are an interesting test-bed for interactive Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems and are also directly useful in a wide range of applications ranging from technical support services to entertainment.</description></item><item><title>DERMADOC: THE SKIN SPECIALIST APPLICATION</title><link>https://tanvidadu.github.io/projects/creations/dermahack/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tanvidadu.github.io/projects/creations/dermahack/</guid><description>Itâ€™s a common practice among people to refer the internet or various easily accessible resources before they consult a doctor. This can often create a sense of panic and confusion if the sources are not reliable.

There already exist some applications which diagnose skin diseases through the textual description provided by the user.</description></item><item><title>IMAGE FORGERY DETECTION APP</title><link>https://tanvidadu.github.io/projects/creations/deepfake/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tanvidadu.github.io/projects/creations/deepfake/</guid><description>Developed an Android application to detect fake human images.It differentiates GAN-generated face-images from real face-images.Methodology involved training ResNet-50 model on a publicly available datasetThe proposed architecture had an accuracy of 90%The trained model was deployed on a Django-based API and made available via Android application.</description></item></channel></rss>
